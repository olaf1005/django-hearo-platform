""" YapDi Example - Demonstrate basic YapDi functionality.
    Author - Kasun Herath <kasunh01@gmail.com>
    USAGE - python basic.py start|stop|restart

    python basic.py start would execute count() in daemon mode 
    if there is no instance already running. 

    count() prints a counting number to syslog. To view output of
    count() execute a follow tail to syslog file. Most probably 
    tail -f /var/log/syslog under linux and tail -f /var/log/messages
    under BSD.

    python basic.py stop would kill any running instance.

    python basic.py restart would kill any running instance; and
    start an instance. """
